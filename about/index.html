<div>I'm an anywhere, anytime, anyone kind of person.</div>
<br>
<div>I don't just do one specific genre of photos, I usually tend to branch out and do whatever I find inspiration in! I can see something in just about anything, and when I do I make sure to capture it! And that's what I'm all about, capturing the moments you never want to forget, big or small!</div>
<br>
<div>I was born in Missouri and I lived there most my life until about the fifth grade. Then my family and I moved to Oklahoma for school/job opportunities. It was a little rough at first. We all had to learn to adapt and change but over the years it got a lot easier and we began the new chapter of our lives. Oklahoma is the place in which I found my passion for photography and because of that, over the years I've learned that change isn't always bad. Sometimes it just leads to bigger and better things!</div>
